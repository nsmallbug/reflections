When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

      It's good idea to use a remote repo in several cases:
    	- when I'm working on a project not by myself;
    	- when I'm working on a project by myself, but using different computers;
    	- when I'm working on a project by myself using one computer - to have some extra copies of work that have been done;
    	- when I want to show or share my work with anoter people;
    You know? I think it's a good idea to use a remote repo as often, as possible.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
